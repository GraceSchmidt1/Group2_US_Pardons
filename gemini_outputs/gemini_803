Here is the Python dictionary with each offense from your dataset assigned to one of the specified categories. For entries that are simply references to "Acts of Congress" or "Criminal Codes" without further descriptive language, a categorization often requires external knowledge. In such cases, and as per the requirement to assign *every* offense to a category, I have used 'Fraud' as a broad default, as many historical federal crimes (especially regulatory, financial, or conspiratorial ones) could fall under this umbrella when specific details are missing. Administrative entries like "Correcting a warrant" or "Court-Japan" have also been arbitrarily assigned to 'Fraud' as a fallback, given the strict requirement to categorize everything.
