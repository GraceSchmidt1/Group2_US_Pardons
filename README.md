# Presidential Clemency Analysis (1789–2017)

## Overview

This project explores patterns, biases, and historical trends in presidential clemency decisions from 1789 to 2017. Using the ICPSR dataset United States Presidential Orders of Clemency (ICPSR 37128), the analysis focuses on understanding who receives clemency, when it is granted, and how these patterns vary across U.S. presidential administrations.

The project combines exploratory data analysis, historical context, and demographic comparisons to highlight disparities and temporal trends related to federal pardons and commutations.

## Research Questions
1. Presidential Trends
- How many pardons and commutations does each president grant?
- How do clemency rates change across administrations and eras?
- Do presidents show a “midnight pardon” spike near the end of their term?

2. Crime-Related Patterns
- What offenses most commonly lead to clemency?
- Are certain crime categories more likely to receive pardons?
- How do crime-specific clemency patterns vary across presidents?

3. Demographic Biases
- Are there differences in clemency outcomes by race, gender, or age?
- How do these compare to incarceration demographics for the same year?
- Are non-citizens granted clemency at different rates?

4. Geographic Patterns
- Do presidents disproportionately grant clemency to individuals from regions they have personal or political ties to?
- How do pardons vary by state or federal district?
- Can mapping (geospatial heatmaps) reveal regional bias?

5. Incarceration Context
- To contextualize clemency patterns, the project also incorporates external incarceration data:
- How do clemency rates compare to national incarceration rates over time?
- In years with higher incarceration rates, do clemency decisions increase or decrease?

## Data Sources
### Primary Dataset

ICPSR 37128 — United States Presidential Orders of Clemency, 1789–2017


Key Analytical Goals

- Quantify clemency frequency by president, crime type, and era
- Identify demographic disparities in clemency decisions
- Visualize temporal patterns, especially end-of-term spikes
- Compare clemency trends to incarceration patterns
- Explore regional favoritism or bias via geographic visualizations
- Build subsets for modern demographic comparison (AGE, GENDER, etc.)
- Detect crime-specific clemency trends across administrations
